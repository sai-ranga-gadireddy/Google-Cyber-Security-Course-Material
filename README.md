Google Cloud Cybersecurity Certificate Overview:-
Hello and welcome to the Google Cloud Cybersecurity Certificate Program! In this program,
you’ll explore the growing field of cloud cybersecurity. You’ll configure cloud resources, apply
security controls, and check for compliance with regulations and standards. You’ll learn how to
help find and fix vulnerabilities, detect and respond to incidents, and document your team’s
processes. You’ll also get hands-on experience with cloud security tools like Google’s Cloud
Shell and Security Command Center.

The courses of the program include:
1. Introduction to Security Principles in Cloud Computing
2. Strategies for Cloud Security Risk Management
3. Cloud Security Risks: Identify and Protect Against Threats
4. Detect, Respond, and Recover from Cloud Cybersecurity Attacks
5. Put It Together: Prepare for a Cloud Security Analyst Job

Hot and cold data:
In storage, there are two ways to describe data and its availability: hot or cold. Hot data is data
that users access frequently. For example, the data used in mobile apps is hot because users
have instant access to their data.
In contrast, cold data is infrequently or rarely accessed. An example of cold data is data used
for record keeping. You might need to keep this kind of data available, but it doesn’t need to be
updated or accessed often.
Cloud storage
Cloud Storage is Google’s storage product for unstructured data or objects, including email,
web content, images, videos, and audio files. Once stored, objects are then saved in buckets. A
bucket is a virtual container that holds objects.

CSPs categorize storage options into different classes ranging in availability and cost. The
more available your data needs to be, the more it’ll cost to store.
Cloud Storage offers four different classes for data storage: standard, nearline, coldline, and
archival.
Standard
The standard storage class is best for hot data, or data that you need to access frequently, and
for short periods of time. Data stored in this class is highly available and retrievable in
milliseconds. Content used for websites, gaming platforms, or streaming videos are all
examples of data that fits the standard storage class.
Another type of data that fits well in the standard storage class is medical data. For example, if
someone is rushed to the hospital for a broken leg, a doctor will collect data for their medical
records, like a description of the injury and x-rays. If the patient needs surgery and physical
therapy, it would be best to store their medical data in the standard class, so that it can be
accessed quickly.
Nearline
Nearline storage is best for data that you only need to access up to once a month. Nearline is
more cost effective than standard storage, and a good option for backing up your data.
In the case of the patient with the broken leg, once their injuries start to heal, they may move
to monthly check-ups. With fewer hospital visits, their records will only need to be accessed
once a month. So, their data can be moved into nearline storage.

Coldline
People who only need to access their data once every 90 days, or once a quarter, can use
coldline storage. Coldline storage is very cost effective because the data being stored is at rest
for long periods of time.
For example, when the patient’s leg is almost healed, they’ll likely only need to see a doctor
once every few months. So, their data can be transferred to coldline storage because doctors
no longer need frequent access to their records.
Archival
Finally, archival storage is best for archiving or backing up data for disaster recovery purposes.
This includes data that is accessed very infrequently, or once a year. Since there’s not as high
of a demand for availability, archival storage is also very cost-effective.
When the patient’s leg is completely healed, and they no longer need check-ups, their data
can be moved to archival storage. This means the patient’s data is still available for retrieval,
but will cost the hospital less money to store.
